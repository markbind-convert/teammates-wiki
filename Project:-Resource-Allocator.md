Add the ability for students to bid for limited supply resources, e.g. time slots, project titles.

Features to consider:
1. Students should be able to put in multiple bids.
1. Bidders should be able to distribute a fixed amount of bidding points among bids, e.g. bidding 80 points for resource X and 20 points for resource Y.
1. There should be a way to give different number of bidding points for different students, if required.
1. After the end of the bidding period, the system should allocate resources based on bid values.
1. There should be a way to tweak the final allocation without breaking allocation rules.
