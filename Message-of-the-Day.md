TEAMMATES used to have a very primitive 'Message of the Day' feature for disseminating information to users, such as announcements about new features. This feature, unfortunately, never went beyond the proof-of-concept stage and was subsequently deprecated.

In this project, you will bring back that feature and enhance it to be more useful and flexible.

Aspects to consider:
1. A way to show different MotD to different user types.
1. A way for users to mark a MotD as 'read' by a user so that the same MotD is not shown to the user multiple times.
1. A way for users to access past MotDs.
