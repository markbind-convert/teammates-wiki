Currently, TEAMMATES has a very primitive 'Message of the Day' feature for disseminating information to users, such as announcements about new features. In this project, you will enhance that feature to be more useful.
Aspects to consider:
1. A way to show different MoD to different user types.
1. A way for users to mark a MoD as 'read' by a user so that the same MoD is not shown to the user multiple times.
1. A way for users to access past MoD's.
