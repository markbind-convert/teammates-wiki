Give student users the ability to publish all feedback received (from multiple courses) as a consolidated report we call the "feedback resume". The expectation is that students can use this feedback resume as a component in their regular resumes, to illustrate how well the student worked with peers and teachers.

Things to consider:
1. Students may want to withhold certain feedback comments, e.g. if the student thinks the feedback is unfair or offensive. We can give users the option to select which ones to publish, but let readers of the feedback resume see how many feedback comments have been withheld.
1. We might need to generate unique URLs to attach to these feedback resumes. Only those who have the URL should be able to access the feedback resume.
1. We can also allow the student to publish comments he/she gave to others.
1. The success of this feature depends on the quality of the feedback. To that end, the system should be designed to improve the quality of feedback comments, e.g. analyzing feedback text and urge users to give better comments if necessary.
1. Provide a mechanism for instructors to 'rate' feedback which also can become a part of the feedback resume, e.g. the resume can show that 3 out of 8 feedback comments given by the student was rated 'good' by instructors.
