Currently, extending the deadline for a session opens it up for all students. In this project, you will add the ability for instructors to extend the deadline of a session for certain students only.

1. An instructor should be able to select which students should be given the extension and specify the new deadline for them.
1. TEAMMATES should send an email to the affected students with a link to submit responses and other details of the extension.
