Currently, only the question description can be rich text.

In this project, you will add the ability to use for other parts of the question, for example, options of an MCQ question. However, rich-text is not easy to display in reports and spreadsheets. We may have to require users to provide a plain-text version as they do now and optionally provide a rich-text version that will only be shown in the submission form.
