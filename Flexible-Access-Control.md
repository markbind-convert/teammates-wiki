Add more flexible user access controls so that different users can be given different privileges.

Currently all instructors of a course has the same access privileges. This is risky, e.g. any instructor can delete the course, and should not continue.

Things to consider:
1. Access control approach to be adopted, e.g. action-based control, role-based control, object-based control, or a combination.
1. Migration of legacy data to the new scheme.
1. Possibility of supporting tutorial groups within a course.
1. Possibility of assigning different instructors to different students in the same course.
