Add the ability for instructors to compose feedback (i.e. when giving feedback to students via TEAMMATES) and comments (when commenting on responses) using previously-saved text snippets, rather than typing everything from scratch.

The feature aims to exploit the fact that instructors rarely answers give completely unique feedback each time. By allowing to save/reuse text snippets, we hope the quality of answers will improve while saving time for instructors.

Features to consider:
1. The ability to define and manage snippets.
1. The ability to identify reusable snippets automatically and save them for later use.
1. The ability to suggest relevant snippets intelligently, instead of the instructor having to select snippets from a repository.
1. The ability to tag snippets.
1. Client-side handling of this feature without a lag and browser incompatibility issues.
