Improve existing questions types and feedback session templates.

1. More configuration options for existing question types.
1. More session templates containing sample questions. (currently we have only two, and one of them is empty!)
1. More stats and better visualization of responses for existing question types.
1. Improvements to the the response submission page, e.g. a way to avoid losing entered responses if the submission failed.
1. Improving the internal design/implementation of questions, e.g. making adding new question types easier, increasing reuse, better testability.
