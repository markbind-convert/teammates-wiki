Implement proper profiling operations for both front-end and back-end (and also in integration) for TEAMMATES.

This is complementary to the Performance Hero and Testing Hero projects.

1. Identifying parts of the app that has high usage frequency and/or high latency, to be profiled.
1. Adding L&P testing infrastructure and test cases. This includes setting up the test data, the frequency of running the L&P tests, and the criteria on whether a code change pass/does not pass profiling.
1. Publishing and/or archiving the performance reports somewhere (need not be public).

The project can concentrate on either back-end or front-end, or tackling both concurrently.
