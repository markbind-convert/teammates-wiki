Currently, a course can have only one team structure. Some instructors may want to change the team structure at different points of the course. In this project, you will add the ability to support multiple team structures within a single course.

One possible approach is to let the instructor upload additional team structures for a course, in addition to the default team structure provided when enrolling students. Each question in a session can then be assigned one of the team structures in the course.

Additionally, we can allow instructors to specify which team structure is the current default so that TEAMMATES can auto-select that team structure in the 'new question' form.
