Add the ability for instructors to upload data about students.

Things to consider:
1. The data is most likely to be in spreadsheet format.
1. Instructors should be able to set visibility  for each column of data.
1. Data should be stored in an optimal format, reducing read/write costs.
1. It should be possible to display these data in various formats (e.g. per student, per course, etc.).
1. Optional: filtering based on data, e.g. total > 50.
1. Optional: to identify and use the type of data, e.g. show average if the column contains numerical data.
