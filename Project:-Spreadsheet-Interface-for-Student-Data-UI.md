Provide a spreadsheet-like interface for uploading student data.

The current UI for uploading/maintaining student data is a frequent source of user errors and therefore can be improved.

Note that we prefer a spreadsheet-like interface (a simpler version of Google sheets) rather than a feature to upload spreadsheets. One significant part of this project is to explore existing third-party libraries and choose one that fits our needs.
