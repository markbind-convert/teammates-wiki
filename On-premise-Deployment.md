We have received support requests for on-premise deployment from potential users who are not willing to store their data in third-party servers.
Adding support for on-premise deployment for TEAMMATES, or at least supporting different storage option (to adhere to the data sharing rules), will mean that we can expand our user base even further.

1. Adding support for using non-Google-based storage options.
1. Adding support for deploying in infrastructure other than Google App Engine Standard Environment.
