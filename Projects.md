All the project ideas listed here are big enough to do as separate short-term sub-projects. Ideas for smaller features can be found in [our issue tracker](../issues).

### General project expectations

Unless stated otherwise:

* The feature should be implemented at production quality.
* The code should be compliant with our coding standard, come with automated tests, and reviewed by (at least) a team member.
* The feature should be released and field-tested.
  * Where database operations are involved, they should be performance-tested with sufficient amount of load.
* The feature should work with legacy data and provide means to migrate legacy data to the new format later, if needed.

### Contacting us about project ideas

In the spirit of OSS, we prefer to discuss about project ideas in the open. Please post your ideas/questions in our issue tracker.

### Defining your own project

* We are open to other project ideas that are aligned with TEAMMATES vision.
* We also welcome projects to improve tooling support (tools to manage our projects and the community) for existing projects or for the team.

When proposing your own project, be sure to bounce your project ideas off us (by posting your ideas/questions in our issue tracker) before you submit a detailed proposal.
This is because we believe that 'less is more' when it comes to features and we do not want to add features 'just because we can'.

### Knowledge requirement

For each project, the knowledge required is described only briefly (e.g. "back-end development/testing"). The actual implementation languages/tools can be found out in the main repository.

### Project statuses
