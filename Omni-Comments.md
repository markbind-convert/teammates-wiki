1. Instructor should be able to add a comment for a student in as few steps as possible, 1-2 steps preferred.

1. Optionally, we can consider rich text comments and comments including other objects such as emoticons, pictures, attachments, links etc.
1. It should be possible to add comments for a group of students, to a team, or multiple teams.
