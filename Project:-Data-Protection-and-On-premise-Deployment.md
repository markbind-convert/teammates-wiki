With the increasing enforcement of personal data protection laws such as Singapore's [PDPA](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Legislation-and-Guidelines/Personal-Data-Protection-Act-Overview) and EU's [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), we need to take a closer inspection on our data protection practice.
While our current practice should have sufficiently protected user data, it is in our best interest to relook and document our practice and policy.

We have also received support requests for on-premise deployment from potential users who are bounded by data sharing rules.
Adding support for on-premise deployment for TEAMMATES, or at least supporting different storage option (to adhere to the data sharing rules), will mean that we can expand our user base even further (although, at that time, it is arguable whether they can truly be called 'our users').

1. Ensuring TEAMMATES have sufficient data protection measures (e.g. access control, security), policy, and backup/disaster (data loss, leak, breach) recovery measures.
1. Adding support for using non-Google-based storage options.
1. Adding support for deploying in infrastructure other than Google App Engine Standard Environment.
