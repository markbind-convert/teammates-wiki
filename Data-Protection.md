With the increasing enforcement of personal data protection laws such as Singapore's [PDPA](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Legislation-and-Guidelines/Personal-Data-Protection-Act-Overview) and EU's [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), we need to take a closer inspection on our data protection practice.
While our current practice should have sufficiently protected user data, it is in our best interest to relook and document our practice and policy.
